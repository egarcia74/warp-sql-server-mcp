### 🛡️ Three-Tier Safety System

The MCP server implements three independent security layers that can be configured separately:

| Security Level                | Environment Variable                      | Default | Impact                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| **🔒 Read-Only Mode**         | `SQL_SERVER_READ_ONLY`                    | `true`  | Only SELECT queries allowed   |
| **⚠️ Destructive Operations** | `SQL_SERVER_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATIONS` | `false` | Controls INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE |
| **🚨 Schema Changes**         | `SQL_SERVER_ALLOW_SCHEMA_CHANGES`         | `false` | Controls CREATE/DROP/ALTER    |

### 🏗️ Security Configurations

### 🚨 Security Status Monitoring

#### Startup Security Summary

The MCP server displays security status on startup in the Warp logs:

```bash
# Maximum Security (Default)
Security: 🔒 SECURE (RO, DML-, DDL-)

# Data Analysis Mode
Security: ⚠️ UNSAFE (RW, DML+, DDL-)
WARNING: Read-write mode, DML allowed - consider stricter settings for production

# Full Development Mode
Security: ⚠️ UNSAFE (RW, DML+, DDL+)
WARNING: Read-write mode, DML allowed, DDL allowed - consider stricter settings for production
```

#### Runtime Security Information

Every query response includes current security status:

```json
{
  "safetyInfo": {
    "readOnlyMode": true,
    "destructiveOperationsAllowed": false,
    "schemaChangesAllowed": false
  }
}
```

### 🔍 Query Validation

The MCP server includes intelligent query validation that:

1. **Analyzes SQL patterns** before execution
2. **Blocks dangerous operations** based on current security settings
3. **Provides clear error messages** explaining why operations were blocked
4. **Suggests configuration changes** when operations are blocked

**Example Security Block:**

```bash
# Attempting INSERT in read-only mode
❌ Query blocked by safety policy: Read-only mode is enabled.
   Only SELECT queries are allowed.
   Set SQL_SERVER_READ_ONLY=false to disable.
```

### 🏥 Production Deployment

#### Recommended Production Configuration

```bash
# PRODUCTION SECURITY SETTINGS (Mandatory)
SQL_SERVER_READ_ONLY=true
SQL_SERVER_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATIONS=false
SQL_SERVER_ALLOW_SCHEMA_CHANGES=false

# ADDITIONAL SECURITY SETTINGS
SQL_SERVER_ENCRYPT=true
SQL_SERVER_TRUST_CERT=false
SQL_SERVER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
SQL_SERVER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
```

#### Security Validation Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] ✅ **Read-only mode enabled** (`SQL_SERVER_READ_ONLY=true`)
- [ ] ✅ **Destructive operations blocked** (`SQL_SERVER_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATIONS=false`)
- [ ] ✅ **Schema changes blocked** (`SQL_SERVER_ALLOW_SCHEMA_CHANGES=false`)
- [ ] ✅ **Encryption enabled** (`SQL_SERVER_ENCRYPT=true`)
- [ ] ✅ **Certificate validation enabled** (`SQL_SERVER_TRUST_CERT=false`)
- [ ] ✅ **Security warnings appear in logs** during startup

- [ ] ✅ **Document security settings** in deployment documentation

### 🔧 Migration from Previous Versions

**⚠️ Breaking Change Notice**: Starting with this version, the MCP server defaults to maximum security (read-only mode).

**If you need write access**, explicitly configure:

```bash
# For data modification capabilities
SQL_SERVER_READ_ONLY=false
SQL_SERVER_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATIONS=true

# For full database operations (development only)
SQL_SERVER_ALLOW_SCHEMA_CHANGES=true
```

### ✅ **Production Validation Status**

**This security system has been comprehensively validated through extensive testing:**

- **✅ Phase 1 (Read-Only)**: 20/20 tests passed - Maximum security validated
- **✅ Phase 2 (DML Operations)**: 10/10 tests passed - Selective permissions validated
- **✅ Phase 3 (DDL Operations)**: 10/10 tests passed - Full development mode validated

#### Total: 40/40 integration tests passed (100% success rate)

| ----------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `SQL_SERVER_READ_ONLY`                    | `true`  | **SECURE**     | When `true`, only SELECT queries allowed |
| `SQL_SERVER_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATIONS` | `false` | **SECURE**     | When `true`, allows INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE |
| `SQL_SERVER_ALLOW_SCHEMA_CHANGES`         | `false` | **SECURE**     | When `true`, allows CREATE/DROP/ALTER    |

⚠️ **Important**: These settings significantly impact security. See [Security section](#-security) for detailed guidance.

### Troubleshooting Configuration

**Common Issues:**

1. **"NTLM authentication error"**
   - Ensure `SQL_SERVER_USER` and `SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD` are set for SQL Server auth
   - Or omit both for Windows authentication

2. **"Connection timeout"**
   - Set `SQL_SERVER_ENCRYPT=false` for local development
   - Verify SQL Server is running on the specified port
   - Check firewall settings

3. **"Server not found"**
   - Verify `SQL_SERVER_HOST` and `SQL_SERVER_PORT` are correct
   - Test connectivity: `telnet localhost 1433`

4. **"Login failed"**
   - Verify username/password in `SQL_SERVER_USER` and `SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD`
   - Ensure the user has database access permissions

**Verification Steps:**

1. Check MCP server logs in Warp for startup messages
2. Look for: "Database connection pool initialized successfully"
3. Test with simple query: "List all databases"
4. Check Warp's MCP server status in Settings

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can use the MCP tools in Warp:

### List all databases

```text
Please list all databases on the SQL Server
```

### Execute a query

```text
Execute this SQL query: SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Users ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC
```

### Describe a table structure

```text
Can you describe the structure of the Orders table?
```

### Get sample data with filtering

```text
Show me 50 rows from the Products table where Price > 100
```

## Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive connection details in environment variables, not in code
- **Least Privilege**: Use database accounts with minimal required permissions
- **Network Security**: Ensure your SQL Server is properly configured for your network environment
- **SSL/TLS**: Consider enabling encryption for production environments

## Authentication Methods

### SQL Server Authentication

Set these environment variables:

```bash
SQL_SERVER_USER=your_username
SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Windows Authentication

Leave `SQL_SERVER_USER` and `SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD` empty. Optionally set:

```bash
SQL_SERVER_DOMAIN=your_domain
```

## Error Handling

The MCP server includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Connection failures
- Authentication issues
- SQL syntax errors
- Permission denied errors
- Network timeouts

All errors are returned as structured MCP error responses with descriptive messages.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### 🪟 **Windows-Specific Troubleshooting**

**SQL Server Configuration:**

1. **Enable TCP/IP Protocol**:
   - Open "SQL Server Configuration Manager"
   - Navigate to "SQL Server Network Configuration" → "Protocols for [Instance]"
   - Enable "TCP/IP" protocol
   - Restart SQL Server service

2. **SQL Server Browser Service**:
   - Open "Services" (services.msc)
   - Start "SQL Server Browser" service
   - Set to "Automatic" startup type

3. **Windows Firewall**:
   - Add inbound rule for port 1433
   - Or temporarily disable firewall for testing

4. **Windows Authentication**:
   - Works seamlessly with domain accounts
   - Run Warp as the user who needs database access
   - No username/password required in configuration

**Testing Connection:**

```powershell
# Test SQL Server connectivity
telnet localhost 1433

# Check SQL Server services
Get-Service -Name "*SQL*"

# Verify port is listening
netstat -an | findstr :1433
```

### 🍎🐧 **macOS/Linux-Specific Troubleshooting**

**Connection Testing:**

```bash
# Test SQL Server connectivity
telnet localhost 1433
# or
nc -zv localhost 1433

# Check if port is reachable
nmap -p 1433 localhost
```

**Common Issues:**

1. **Remote SQL Server**: Often requires SQL Server Authentication
2. **SSL/TLS**: May need `SQL_SERVER_ENCRYPT=true` for remote connections
3. **Network**: Check firewall rules on SQL Server host
4. **Docker**: If using SQL Server in Docker, ensure port mapping

### General Connection Issues

- **Verify SQL Server is running** and accepting connections on port 1433
- **Check firewall settings** on both client and server
- **Ensure TCP/IP protocol is enabled** in SQL Server Configuration Manager
- **Verify authentication credentials** are correct

### Permission Issues

- **Ensure the connecting user has appropriate database permissions**
- **For Windows Authentication**: Run the process with appropriate user context
- **For SQL Server Authentication**: Verify the SQL login exists and has permissions

### Network Issues

- **Test connectivity** using tools like `telnet localhost 1433`
- **Check SQL Server network configuration**
- **Verify named pipes vs TCP/IP settings**
- **Check for VPN or proxy interference**
